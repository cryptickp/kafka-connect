Kafka Connect is a system for moving data into and out of Kafka. All Debezium connectors adhere to the Kafka Connector API for source connectors, and each monitors a specific kind of database management system for changing data, and then forwards those changes directly into Kafka topics organized by server, database, and table. This image defines a runnable Kafka Connect service preconfigured with all Debezium connectors. The service has a RESTful API for managing connector instances -- simply start up a container, configure a connector for each data source you want to monitor, and let Debezium monitor those sources for changes and forward them to the appropriate Kafka topics.
